storage.py file provides an abstraction layer for database storage engines used in ElectrumX, which is a server implementation for the Bitcoin protocol. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of its components:

Key Components:
Imports: The module imports necessary libraries, including os, pytest, and utility functions from electrumx.lib.util.

db_class(name) Function:

This function returns a database engine class based on the provided name. It raises a pytest.skip() if the name is "skip".
It searches for subclasses of the Storage class and imports the relevant module for the specified database class.
Storage Class:

An abstract base class that defines the interface for database storage engines.
It initializes with a database name and a flag for synchronization. If the database does not exist, it opens or creates one.
Contains several abstract methods that subclasses must implement: import_module, open, close, get, put, write_batch, and iterator.
LevelDB Class:

A concrete implementation of the Storage class using the LevelDB database engine.
Implements required methods and uses the plyvel library to interact with LevelDB.
RocksDB Class:

Another concrete implementation of the Storage class, this time for the RocksDB database engine.
It provides specific configurations for opening a RocksDB instance and implements methods for database operations using the rocksdb library.
RocksDBWriteBatch Class:

This class manages write batches for RocksDB. It ensures that multiple writes can be executed as a single batch operation, committing only if no exceptions occur.
RocksDBIterator Class:

This class allows iteration over key-value pairs in RocksDB, with support for prefixes and reverse iteration. It ensures that only keys that start with the specified prefix are yielded.
Summary:
Overall, storage.py serves as a foundational component for managing different database backends (LevelDB and RocksDB) within the ElectrumX server. 
It defines an abstract interface for database operations, ensuring that various implementations can be used interchangeably while adhering to a common set of methods and behaviors.
