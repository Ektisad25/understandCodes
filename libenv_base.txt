This code defines the EnvBase class, which is responsible for managing server environment configuration in a Python application. The class provides methods to read and handle environment variables for various configuration settings.

Key Components:
Imports:

environ: Accesses environment variables.
class_logger: A utility to create class-specific loggers (from the electrumx library).
EnvBase Class:

Purpose: Manages configuration values by reading environment variables and provides defaults if the variables are not set.
Key Methods:

__init__(): Initializes the class, sets up a logger, and reads some environment variables (ALLOW_ROOT, EVENT_LOOP_POLICY).
default(envvar, default): Retrieves the value of an environment variable, returning a default value if the variable is not set.
boolean(envvar, default): Returns a boolean value based on the environment variable, interpreting "Yes" as True.
required(envvar): Retrieves a required environment variable, raising an error if it is missing.
integer(envvar, default): Retrieves an environment variable and converts it to an integer, returning a default if not set.
custom(envvar, default, parse): Allows custom parsing of environment variables by passing a parser function.
obsolete(envvars): Checks for obsolete environment variables and raises an error if any are set.
event_loop_policy(): Retrieves the event loop policy. If set to uvloop, it imports and uses the uvloop library, otherwise raises an error for unknown policies.
Summary:
This class is designed to simplify the handling of environment configurations for a server by providing defaults, validations, and conversion functions for environment variables. It also allows for custom event loop policies like uvloop.
