Key features include:

Database Management: Handles opening, closing, and reading the state of the history database, with version control for database upgrades.
Transaction History: Allows for the addition of unflushed transaction entries and provides methods to fetch transaction numbers for specific script hashes.
Compaction: Implements methods for compaction of historical data to optimize storage, including mechanisms for backing up and removing outdated entries.
Memory Management: Monitors unflushed data sizes and enforces limits to prevent excessive memory usage.
This module is crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of transaction history in the ElectrumX server.
