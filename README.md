New DB Backends: Introduced additional database backends, such as RocksDB and LevelDB, providing users with more options for data storage.
self.headers_file = util.LogicalFile('meta/headers', 2, 16000000)
self.tx_counts_file = util.LogicalFile('meta/txcounts', 2, 2000000)
self.hashes_file = util.LogicalFile('meta/hashes', 4, 16000000)

Improved Protocol Handling: Enhanced the handling of various protocol operations, including optimizations for JSON-RPC and WebSocket.
Faster Sync Times: Reduced the time taken to sync with the blockchain, leading to improved client experience.
Added Features for Mempool: Introduced features to provide better insights into the mempool, allowing users to see pending transactions more effectively.
Security Enhancements: Included various security improvements to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities.
saturation: Monitors the size of various caches and triggers flushes based on predefined thresholds to optimize memory usage.
Estimation of Remaining Transactions (estimate_txs_remaining method):
Flushes in-memory data to the database, ensuring consistency between the cached state and the persistent storage.
Cache Management (check_cache_size method):
