code snippet consists of three functions that generate formatted lines of output for displaying information about sessions, groups, and peers in a server environment, likely for an ElectrumX server or a similar context. Each function processes data returned by specific RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods and formats it for easy readability.

Key Functions Breakdown
sessions_lines(data):

Purpose: Generates formatted lines for displaying session information.
Input:
data: A list of session details, typically returned from an rpc_sessions() call.
Output: A generator that yields formatted strings containing session details.
Formatting: The output includes various session attributes like ID, flags, client information, protocol, costs, requests, transactions, subscriptions, and connection time, formatted for alignment in a table-like structure.
groups_lines(data):

Purpose: Generates formatted lines for displaying group information.
Input:
data: A list of group details, typically returned from an rpc_groups() call.
Output: A generator that yields formatted strings containing group details.
Formatting: Each line shows group attributes such as name, session count, costs, retained costs, requests, transactions, subscriptions, and data received/sent, again formatted for clarity.
peers_lines(data):

Purpose: Generates formatted lines for displaying peer information.
Input:
data: A list of peer details, typically returned from an rpc_peers() call.
Output: A generator that yields formatted strings containing peer details.
Time Formatting: The inner function time_fmt(t) formats time-related data, converting timestamps into human-readable formats, defaulting to "Never" for peers that haven't been seen.
Formatting: The output includes attributes such as hostname, status, TCP and SSL ports, server version, protocol min/max versions, pruning status, and timing information for last good and last try, formatted into a neatly aligned table.
Example Output Structure
The structure of the formatted output can be represented as follows:
