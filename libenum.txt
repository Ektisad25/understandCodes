This code defines two classes, EnumError and Enumeration, which implement a custom enumeration system in Python, similar to Python's built-in enum module. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. EnumError (Custom Exception Class):
EnumError is a subclass of Exception and is raised when there is an issue with the enumeration, such as a non-unique name or value, or an incorrect data type (e.g., expecting a string or integer).
2. Enumeration Class:
Purpose: This class allows you to create a custom enumeration from a list of names and values.
Attributes:
lookup: A dictionary that maps enum names (strings) to their corresponding values (integers).
reverseLookup: A dictionary that maps enum values (integers) to their corresponding names (strings).
Key Methods:
__init__(self, name, enumList):
Initializes the enumeration with a name and a list of enum members.
enumList can be a list of strings (names) or tuples (name, value) pairs.
Validates that the names are unique strings and the values are unique integers.
Populates lookup and reverseLookup dictionaries for quick lookup of names and values.
__getattr__(self, attr):
This method allows accessing enum values as if they were attributes. For example, if you have an enum member called RED, you could access its value with enum.RED.
If an invalid enum name is accessed, it raises an AttributeError.
whatis(self, value):
This method performs a reverse lookup: given an enum value (integer), it returns the corresponding enum name (string).
Example Usage:
colors = Enumeration('Colors', [('RED', 1), ('GREEN', 2), ('BLUE', 3)])

# Accessing enum values:
print(colors.RED)    # Output: 1

# Reverse lookup:
print(colors.whatis(2))   # Output: 'GREEN'

Error Handling:
If a name isn't a string or a value isn't an integer, an EnumError is raised.
Duplicate names or values will also raise EnumError, ensuring that the enumeration is unique and valid.
Summary:
The Enumeration class allows creating a custom enumeration system with strict validation on the names and values, and it provides both name-to-value and value-to-name lookups.
